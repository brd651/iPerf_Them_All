# iPerf_Them_All
Wrote this script to work with multiple iPerf Servers and a list of common ports so that one can run this and come back later to review the results of the testing. 

This was orginally created for testing throughput on Common Ports through firewalls, to check and see if there are any variations in speed handling. This becomes especially usesful when a DPI-SSL proxy is in use.
